==========

Name
----
ngcpcfg - central and template based Configuration Management

Synopsis
--------
ngcpcfg <action> [ options ]

Introduction
------------

ngcpcfg is a Configuration Management System, developed for the Sipwise Next
Generation Platform. It provides a central mechanism for handling configuration
changes, updates and synchronisation between servers through a main
configuration which is simple and easy to read and modify.

tl;dr? - ngcpcfg for the impatient
----------------------------------

The main system configuration is done in the file _/etc/ngcp-config/config.yml_.
After modifying the file execute 'ngcpcfg apply' to build the accordingly
configurations file.

Taxonomy
--------

*central yml files*:: *.yml files inside _/etc/ngcp-config/_

*High Availability setup*:: ngcpcfg running in a cluster setup (e.g.
sip:providerPRO or sip:carrier), depends on Debian package ngcp-ngcpcfg-ha.

*local repository*:: the directory _/etc/ngcp-config/_, being a Git repository

*remote systems*:: the other nodes inside a High Availability setup, as defined
in _/etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg_

*shared repository*:: Git repository shared amongst nodes inside a High
Availability setup, as defined by the GLUSTERFS setting in
/etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.d/shared_storage.cfg (requires ngcp-ngcpcfg-ha) and
being _/mnt/glusterfs_ by default

*templates*:: template toolkit files with .tt2 suffix, found in
_/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/_

[[configfiles]]
Configuration files
-------------------

Main configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* _/etc/ngcp-config/config.yml_: central configuration file, to be configured with
$EDITOR, webfrontend,...

* _/etc/ngcp-config/config.$HOSTNAME.yml_: host specific configuration file,
depending on the hostname (:= $HOSTNAME) of the system.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/config.local.yml_: local configuration, not being host
specific.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/constants.yml_: configuration file that has precedence over
any other .yml file _/etc/ngcp-config/_, defining important constant settings.
This file is *not* supposed to be modified by the user (without having a very
good reason).

* _/etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.cfg_: main configuration file for ngcpcfg itself,
provides global variables used inside ngcpcfg and its helper scripts. This file
is *not* supposed to be modified by the user (without having a very good
reason).

* _/etc/ngcp-config/config.d/_: optional configuration directory with additional
yml configuration files. Files inside this directory aren't supposed to be
added or modified by the user. The purpose of this configuration directory is
that software packages can enable/disable certain features through configuration
options on demand.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.d/_: configuration directory for ngcpcfg itself.
Files with suffix '.cfg' inside this directory are sourced after
/etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.cfg has been read. Files inside this directory are
*not* supposed to be modified by the user (without having a very good reason).

[IMPORTANT]
Configuration file priority: constants.yml takes precedence over
all files in _/etc/ngcp-config/config.d/_, over config.local.yml,
over config.$HOSTNAME.yml, over config.yml.

High Availability setup specific configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* _/etc/ngcp_ha_node_: defines node name in the High Availability setup, usually
being _sp1_ for the first node and _sp2_ for the second node.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg_: configuration file that specifies to which
hosts changes should be pushed to.

Supported template files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example for generating a configuration file named_/etc/foobar/baz_:

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.tt2_: main and default template
file, used by template-handler for generating /etc/foobar/baz. Configuration
file is usually provided by a Debian package.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.customtt.tt2_: system specific
template file, but configuration usually isn't provided by a Debian package and
can be modified independent from any Debian package mechanism.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.tt2.$HA_NODE_: node specific
template file. $HA_NODE is determined using the content of /etc/ngcp_ha_node
(usually being _sp1_ for the first node and _sp2_ for the second node on the
Sipwise Next Generation Platform). Wheras _*customtt.tt2_ files are used on all
nodes in a High Availability setup the _*.tt2.$HA_NODE*_ file is specific for
the single node only. A common usage case is master vs. slave configuration of a
service. Configuration file is usually provided by a Debian package. Note:
Feature is available in the High Availability setup only.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.customtt.tt2.$HA_NODE_: node
specific template file. Regarding $HA_NODE the same as for _baz.tt2.$HA_NODE_
applies (see previous bullet), but the configuration file usually isn't provided
by a Debian package but can be modified independent from any Debian package
mechanism. Note: Feature is available in the High Availability setup only.

[IMPORTANT]
Configuration file priority: *.customtt.tt2.$HA_NODE takes precedence over
*.customtt.tt2, over *.tt2.$HA_NODE, over *.tt2.

Support action related files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example for handling a configuration file named _/etc/foobar/baz_:

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.services_: service file, defining
actions that have to be executed when file /etc/foobar/baz was modified.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/ngcpcfg.services_: service file,
defining actions that have to be executed whenever *any* file inside /etc/foobar
was modified.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.postbuild_: script which is
executed *after* a configuration file (/etc/foobar/baz) has been generated. The
environment variable "$output_file" containing the file name of the generated
configuration file (/etc/foobar/baz) is available within the postbuild script. A
common usage case for postbuild files is adjusting file permissions.

* _/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/foobar/baz.prebuild_: script which is
executed *before* a configuration file (/etc/foobar/baz) is generated. The
environment variable "$output_file" containing the file name of the generated
configuration file (/etc/foobar/baz) is available within the postbuild script.

Syntax and layout of configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* _/etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.cfg_: plain shell syntax style "key=value" entries

* _/etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg_: one hostname or IP address per line

* _central yml files_ (*.yml): YAML configuration syntax (see http://yaml.org/)

* _template files_ (*.tt2): whatever the according software (Kamailio,
MySQL,...) needs. Any variables that should be replaced by the configuration
management system (based on the main configuration files *.yml inside
/etc/ngcp-config/) have to be written in the YAML syntax (see http://yaml.org/)

* _service files_ (*.services) and _build files_ ({post,pre}build): file will be
executed under "bash $FILE", so you can use commands e.g. like
"/etc/init.d/foobar restart" and any further shell scripting syntax inside the
services files

Options
-------

  **--debug** <action> [<further_options>]::

Run actions (see next section) in verbose mode, useful for debugging.

  **--help**::

Display usage information and exit.

  **--version**::

Display ngcpcfg version and exit.

Actions
-------

  **apply**::

Executes the _build_, _services_ and _commit_ commands in a batch (assuming each
command worked as expected). This option serves as a shortcut for the most
commonly executed commands.

  **build** [--modified-only] [<files_or_directories>|<pattern>]::

Generate configuration files, based on values defined the central yml files and
based on the templates in the configuration tree (/etc/ngcp-config/templates by
default). The *--modified-only* option checks for _modified_ and _uncommitted_
configuration files (central yml files and templates) and builds the relevant
files only. If a central yml file is modified it builds all configuration files.
If changes are in template files only just the according template files are
considered for rebuild. If a file (e.g. _/etc/rsyslog.conf_) or directory (e.g.
_/etc/mysql/_) is provided as argument to the _build_ option only the specified
file / files inside the directory will be generated. If the argument doesn't
start with the /etc prefix the argument is considered as pattern, matching all
files/directories which include the specified pattern. The pattern can include
shell globbing patterns - so argument 'mo..t' will match the files
/etc/ngcp-monitoring-tools/collective-check.conf, /etc/monit/monitrc,
/etc/ha.d/resource.d/monit-services and /etc/default/monit iff they are present.
You can combine _<files_or_directories>_ and _<pattern>_ and use multiple
arguments.

  **commit** [<commit_message>]::

Commit all modified files in _/etc/ngcp-config_ and record changes in _/etc_ by
executing the etckeeper(8) command through
'/usr/share/ngcp-ngcpcfg/scripts/etckeeper'. To check whether there are any
pending changes to be committed execute 'ngcpcfg status'.

  **decrypt**::

Decrypt /etc/ngcp-config-crypted.tgz.gpg and restore configuration files,
doing the reverse operation of the _encrypt_ option.
Note: This feature is only available if the ngcp-ngcpcfg-locker package is
installed.

  **diff** [<options_for_git_diff>]::

Show changes between ngcpcfg's Git repository and the working tree inside
_/etc/ngcp-config_. You can specify options for the underlying 'git diff'
command, e.g. 'ngcpcfg diff HEAD^' will show all changes that have been recorded
with the last _commit_ operation (see manpage git-rev-parse(1) for details how
to specify revisions). If the tool doesn't report anything it means that there
are neither any uncommited changes nor any new or removed files (files which are
not yet (un)registered to the repository).

  **encrypt**::

Encrypt /etc/ngcp-config and all resulting configuration files with a user
defined password and save the result as /etc/ngcp-config-crypted.tgz.gpg.
Note: This feature is only available if the ngcp-ngcpcfg-locker package is
installed.

  **help**::

Display usage information and exit.

  **initialise**::

If ngcpcfg was installed but isn't configured yet the 'initialise' option sets
up ngcpcfg accordingly. Follow the instructions from the <<setup_instructions,
Setup instructions>> section.

  **init-mgmt** <server>::

Set up specified '<server>' for usage as shared repository whereas '<server>'
usually corresponds to the IP/hostname of the central management system in a
sip:carrier environment. Further details about the details of the setup
are available in the <<init-mgmt>> section.
Note: This feature is only available if the ngcp-ngcpcfg-carrier package is installed.

  **pull**::

Retrieve modifications from shared repository.
Note: This option is available in the High Availability setup only.

  **push** [--nobuild] [--noapply] [--shared-only] [<host(s)>]::

Push modifications to shared repository and remote systems. After changes have been
pushed to the node the _apply_ operation will be executed on each remote system
to rebuild the configuration files (unless the '--noapply' operation has been
specified, then only the _build_ operation will be executed). To skip building
any configuration files at all the '--nobuild' option can be specified (implying
to also skip the _apply_ operation).  If the '--shared-only' option is set then
the any pending commits will be pushed only to the shared repository only, any
foreign hosts will be skipped then.  If hostname(s) or IP address(es) is given
as argument then the changes will be pushed to the shared repository and to the
given hosts only. If no host has has been specified then the hosts specified in
_/etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg_ are used.
Note: This option is available in the High Availability setup only.

  **services** [--dry-run]::

Execute any defined service actions for modified configuration files. If the
_--dry-run_ option is present the services won't be executed but you'll be
noticed which service files would be executed if being invoked without the
_--dry-run__ option.

  **status** [--local-only]::

Display the current state of the configuration system, like modified
configuration files and pending actions.
Note: The _--local-only_ option is available in the High Availability setup
only and disables checking any remote systems (useful when the remote
system isn't available).


Usage examples
--------------

The main workflow *without* High Availability setup is:

  ngcpcfg status                      # check for pending operations
  $EDITOR /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml # adjust/extend configuration
  ngcpcfg apply "summary of changes"  # build configs, run services + commit changes

If you do not want to execute the _apply_ shortcut command but instead run the
single actions, then you can execute:

  ngcpcfg status                      # check for pending operations
  $EDITOR /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml # adjust/extend configuration
  ngcpcfg build                       # generate/update configuration files
  ngcpcfg services                    # restart services for modified configs
  ngcpcfg commit "summary of changes" # register changes

The main workflow *with* High Availability setup is:

  ngcpcfg status                      # check for pending operations
  ngcpcfg pull                        # retrieve possibly pending updates
  $EDITOR /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml # adjust/extend configuration
  ngcpcfg build                       # generate/update configuration files
  ngcpcfg services                    # restart services for modified configs
  ngcpcfg commit "summary of changes" # register changes
  ngcpcfg push                        # upload changes to shared storage + remote systems
  ngcpcfg status                      # check for possibly outstanding issues

[[faq]]
Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

What does ngcpcfg mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'ngcp' is the http://www.sipwise.com/[Sipwise Next Generation Communication
Platform] and 'cfg' stands for the ConFiGuration management system of the
ngcp system.

Does ngcpcfg require a shared storage?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only if you are using ngcpcfg in a High Availability setup and using the 'push'
functionality (which is highly recommended in a HA Setup).

How does the configuration management system work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ngcpcfg takes the central yml files (/etc/ngcp-config/*.yml) as input for
configuration, searches for supported templates files (*.tt2) in the template
pool (_/etc/ngcp-config/templates/etc/_) and builds the resulting configuration
files in _/etc_.

[[errorhandling]]
Error handling - what does this error message mean?
---------------------------------------------------

Error message:

  Error: Failed hosts:  hostname (down)

Background: The system "hostname" is not reachable via ICMP, which means it's
not reachable for the ngcpcfg system.

How to fix: Make sure the system is up and running and reachable via ssh from
the system where you are running the "pull" action.

Error message:

  error: Your local changes to 'config.yml' would be overwritten by merge. Aborting.

Background: the file 'config.yml' (in this example) on the system where you are
pushing to contains local modifications which are uncommitted yet. To avoid data
damage the system can't resolve this situation automatically.

How to fix:

1) Throw away the changes on the remote system (where you are pushing to,
important: your changes on the system where you are executing the commands will
be gone!):

  cd /etc/ngcp-config ; git checkout -- config.yml

To get rid of *any* modified files (included added/removed files) the following
commands will do the job (use with care and only execute it if you're aware of
the consequences):

  cd /etc/ngcp-config
  git checkout -- .
  git clean -xdf

2) Resolve the merge conflict:

  cd /etc/ngcp-config
  git pull
  $EDITOR config.yml # resolve conflict
  ngcpcfg commit 'merge conflict on system sp2'
  ngcpcfg pull # just to make sure
  ngcpcfg push # push changes back to the other systems

[[init-mgmt]]
init-mgmt setup
---------------

This section documents the 'ngcpcfg init-mgmt' feature in more detail.
The feature is provided through the ngcp-ngcpcfg-carrier package.

The script deprecates the shared repository /mnt/glusterfs/ngcpcfg-share of the
local system by renaming it to /mnt/glusterfs/ngcpcfg-share.unused. It then
registers the two according nodes (the local system plus the second node which
makes the PRO pair) in /etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg. It sets the 'mgmgt_server'
variable in /etc/ngcp-config/carrier.cfg to '<server>'. Then it makes sure that
the automated login via SSH between the two according nodes as well as the
<server> works. It clones the local shared repository to the '<server>'. Finally
it updates the remote origin for the shared repository on both nodes to point to
'<server>:/mnt/glusterfs/ngcpcfg_<role>' whereas '<role>' corresponds to the
system's hostname without the trailing 'a' and 'b' suffix.

[NOTE]
To check which remote repository is in use execute
'cd /etc/ngcp-config; git remote show origin | grep URL'.

[[setup_instructions]]
Setup instructions
------------------

Requirements for High Availability setup:

* glusterfs is supposed to be set up working and deployed at /mnt/glusterfs
  (as defined via /etc/ngcp-config/ngcpcfg.cfg)

* hosts are expected to be set up for automatic ssh login (ssh-keygen && ssh-copy-id)

* node names are expected to be sp1 and sp2 so the .tt2.sp1 and .tt2.sp2
template files are supported

Configuration on sp1 (expected to be master node in initial setup):

 ngcpcfg initialise
 ngcpcfg build
 printf "sp1\nsp2\n" > /etc/ngcp-config/systems.cfg
 ngcpcfg commit "provide systems.cfg"

Configuration on sp2 (and any further existing system):

 ngcpcfg initialise
 ngcpcfg build

Please note that you do not have to run this steps if you are using the Sipwise
Next Generation Platform since the installation steps are fully automated.

Involved frameworks
-------------------

* git: Distributed Version Control system
* tt2: Template Toolkit
* make: Utility for Directing compilation
* yaml: Generic data serialization language

Limitations
-----------

ngcpcfg was designed specifically for the Sipwise Next Generation Platform,
though with being as generic as possible in mind. The system is supposed to be
useful for configuration management on other systems/platforms and it's possible
to adapt it for different needs through a variety of configuration parameters,
though keep in mind that ngcpcfg was implemented for some very specific use
cases.
