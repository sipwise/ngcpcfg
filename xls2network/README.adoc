Network XLS2YML
===============

What is it about?
-----------------

We have clients sharing their network configuration in XLS files with us.
We want to parse these XLS files and generate the according network.yml for usage on NGCP and its ngcpcfg system.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

To avoid having to set up and maintain large network.yml files manually.

How to install
--------------

You can install this software in a virtual environment.
We recommend to run the Makefile:

[source,bash]
make install

otherwise, you need to run ``setup.py``:

[source,bash]
python3 setup.py install

How to run
----------

An executable ``xls2yml`` will be installed (in virtualenv's ``bin`` directory).
Run ``xls2yml -h`` to see the usage description.
