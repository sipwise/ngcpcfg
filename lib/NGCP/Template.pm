=head1 NAME

NGCP::Template - Custom NGCP Template Toolkit module

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a custom instance of the Template Toolkit so that it can
be used to expose all the necessary functionality expected from within the NGCP
template files, including our ngcp object variable.

=head1 METHODS

=over 8

=item $tt = NGCP::Template->new($config)

Create a new Template compatible object that can be used in place of the stock
Template module.

The $config argument contains any additional arguments for the Template
constructor.

=item $tt->process($input, \%vars, $output, %options)

This method injects the ngcp object variable into the %vars, and calls the
parent Template process() method.
