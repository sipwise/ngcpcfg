      "message": "I think that it\u0027s the other way around, \"if not zero\" / \"if not empty\"?\n\nAlso this does not not seem necessary, because if there are no elements in the array, the for-loop in the line below has 0 iterations, does not execute.  Example:\n\n  $ a\u003d()\n  $ for e in \"${a[@]}\"; do echo \"element: ${e}\"; done\n  $ [empty output, the body of the for-loop didn\u0027t execute any time]\n\nSo, in summary, I think that the \"if\" in line 88 is not needed, but if it was, I think that it\u0027s the wrong condition.",
