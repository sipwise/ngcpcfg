      "message": "tmpdir is a so called python/pytest fixture, provided ready-to-use by pytest for us. It creates a temporary directory, specific for each single test case. This code-line means we\u0027ll have a temporary directory which includes a tmpfile.txt where the actual action takes place, so after the run it looks like:\n\nroot@47d372378bb9:/code# ls /tmp/pytest-0/test_set_action_generate_dicti0/set_action/\ntmpfile.txt\nroot@47d372378bb9:/code# cat /tmp/pytest-0/test_set_action_generate_dicti0/set_action/tmpfile.txt \n---\naaa:\n  bbb: 123\n\n\nWe do NOT operate with /etc/ngcp-config/ at all here, for at least the following reasons:\n\na) it\u0027s a system wide directory, where a normal user doesn\u0027t have according permissions (tests would require root permissions then and mess with system state)\nb) it\u0027s not safe for parallel runs (see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist)",
