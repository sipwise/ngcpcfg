      "message": "Guys I think we overcomplicate it. I guess it\u0027s easier to:\n\n1. Add db changeset which resets LI flag\n\n2. Change 804000016_move_li_admins.up - add administrator to default list.\n\nIn this way the new installation will be ok.\n\nUpgrade step should copy LI admins to config.yml:lawful_intercept_admins as usual. It should be run before ngcp_update_db_schema so db chaneset will reset flags for all users.\n\nRegarding email column - actually no sense to wait for it as all the users after upgrade will have empty emails according to column\u0027s default value.\n\nIn this case the admin users will stay in the system. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s ok or we should drop them. I\u0027d say that we should not delete them but if it\u0027s necessary - delete them in db changeset along with LI reset.",
