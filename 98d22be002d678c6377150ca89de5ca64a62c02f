      "message": "Oh, hmm. I tend to list and group them in --help output and man pages by relevance and theme, so that more relevant/used options/commands go first, and then any related option goes together. I\u0027ve never found a strongly compelling reason to have them listed alphabetically, because if you are searching you can always just text search. But dunno, let\u0027s see what Mika says. :)",

      "message": "If there\u0027s a (sane) grouping with sections possible I prefer the grouping by relevance/theme as well. Though if there are no further sub sections then the man pages I usually see also follow the alphabetic ordering, AFAICS this is also what man pages like cd/tar/... do. Of course \"you can always just text search\", but when going through man pages it helps with the mental model and remembering where you left of, IMO.\n\nSo I\u0027d prefer to keep the alphabetic ordering (though I admit I don\u0027t have too strong opinion regarding the --help/--man/--version options here, which can be seen as kind of generic/\"special\").",
