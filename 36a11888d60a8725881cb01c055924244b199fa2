Checking for existence of /usr/share/ngcp-ngcpcfg/scripts/get and only if that script doesn\u0027t exist, falling back to `ngcpcfg values ..` should be easy to handle, do we actually have any supported systems out there that don\u0027t provide \u0027ngcpcfg values\u0027 yet and where we need to do the manual fallback?",
